<h1>Whitbread Product Developer test</h1>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>I decided to use Angular 2 for this app, even though it is just a small application. This is mainly due to the great DOM binding that Angular 2 offers, it is very easy to display data on a page without having to manually create bindings and events. This means very clean code.</p>
<p>It's also perfect for creating modular code that is easily testable.</p>
<p>I chose Bootstrap for responsiveness and speed.</p>

<h3>To Run Code</h3>
<p>Node is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>1. <strong>NPM install</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>NPM start</strong></p>

<h3>To Run in Dev Mode (Tests/Lint etc)</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Rename package.json.dev > package.json</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Rename package.json > package.json.prod</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>NPM install</strong></p>
<p>4. NPM start or test</p>
<p>5. grunt lint</p>
